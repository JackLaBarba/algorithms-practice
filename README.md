# Algorithms practice

I've been reading through 
[CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms) and 
[The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/). This repo is a
place for me to practice what I'm learning. I'll mostly focus on attempting to
re-implement from memory algorithms which pertain to basic data structures and
graphs.

This is really just a scratch space for me, but I'd be flattered if you found
this interesting.
